# Furry Race Compatibility for Combat Extended

These patches will extend Combat Extended compatibility to a few alien races. For the most part.

------Races Patched
- Leeani
- Xenn
- Racc
- Frijjid
- Fennex
- Ferrex
- Logann
- Orassans
- Ni'Hal
- Equium
- Sergals and Gnolls

All of the races have been tested and function with Combat Extended.

The same can't be said for much of their equipment. While most of the guns and armor work within CE, they are still in need of tweaking.

------Notes of note:
- All of the alien weapons are largely untested outside of seeing if they hold ammo and shoot. Needless to say, they have not been balanced.
- The Xenn Frost Cannon sets things on fire.
- The Orassan Rocketlauncher is more or less a reskinned RPG.
- The Orassan Cryolauncher refused to be patched and thus has infinite ammo. Seems to work just fine, otherwise.
- The Ferret F90 uses more common ammunition.
- Most of the alien races somehow have access to Orassan and Ni'hal guns.
- The Orassan and Ni'Hal guns might be kinda OP.
- I think I made the drakes a little hardcore.

Feedback is appreciated!

------Installation
To install, extract the contents into your Combat Extended folder. Agree to any overwrites and you'll be set.
There are two folders you'll be working with: Patches and Ammo. You'll need to move these folders into your Combat Extended folder. 
Don't put it in your Rimworld Mods folder and load it through the modlist, it won't work because I haven't figured out how to make that work. 
- You will most likely need a local copy of CE. This is because these patches need to be included with your CE's own patches, as it works off of their architecture or something.

Here are some ways to get a local copy of CE!

- You can download it from CE's official GitHub [HERE](https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/releases).
- You can use [Mod List Backup](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=29420.0) to import a local copy of CE from Steam lickety split.
- Steam Workshop actually stores a local copy of CE! You'll find it in in your Steam directory, under Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/294100/960237962. I wouldn't recommend dropping the patches in there, as Steam Workshop might undo everything the next time it tries to update, but you can probably copy that folder into Mods, rename it to Combat Extended, and use it from there.
