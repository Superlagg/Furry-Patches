# Furry Race Compatibility for Combat Extended

These patches will extend Combat Extended compatibility to a few alien races. For the most part.

------Races Patched
- Leeani
- Xenn
- Racc
- Frijjid
- Fennex
- Ferrex
- Logann
- Orassans
- Equium

All of the races have been tested and function with Combat Extended.

The same can't be said of much of their equipment. While most of the guns and armor work within CE, they're more or less placeholders for when I go in and actually get everything to work the way they should.

------Notes of note:
- Xenn and Orassan weaponry, while functional, is largely untested outside of seeing if they hold ammo and shoot. Needless to say, they have not been balanced.
- I have no idea if Xenn and Orassan armors work the way they should. Same with any of the other race's native gear.
- The Logann's shotgun straight up doesn't work. It holds ammo and looks mean, but it can't be fired and the bayonette cuts like a butter knife.
- The Xenn Frost Cannon sets things on fire.
- The Ferret Guns are wholesale ripped off of the Rimfire CE patch.
- Equium, Logann, ~~and Orassan~~ pawns don't carry any ammunition.
- Orassans might spawn with ammo. Might.
- Some Leeani troops don't carry ammunition due to being small woodland creatures.

Feedback is appreciated!

------Installation
To install, extract the contents into your Combat Extended folder. Agree to any overwrites and you'll be set.
There are two folders you'll be working with: Patches and Ammo. You'll need to move these folders into your Combat Extended folder. 
Don't put it in your Rimworld Mods folder and load it through the modlist, it won't work because I haven't figured out how to make it work like that _yet_. 
- You will most likely need a local copy of CE. This is because these patches need to be included with your CE's own patches, as it works off of their architecture or something.

Here are some ways to get a local copy of CE!

- You can download it from CE's official GitHub [HERE](https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/releases).
- You can use [Mod List Backup](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=29420.0) to import a local copy of CE from Steam lickety split.
- Steam Workshop actually stores a local copy of CE! You'll find it in in your Steam directory, under Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/294100/960237962. I wouldn't recommend dropping the patches in there, as Steam Workshop might undo everything the next time it tries to update, but you can probably copy that folder into Mods, rename it to Combat Extended, and use it from there.
