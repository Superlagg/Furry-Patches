# Furry Race Compatibility for Combat Extended

These patches will extend Combat Extended compatibility to a few alien races. For the most part.

These races include:
- Leeani
- Xenn
- Racc
- Frijjid
- Fennex
- Ferrex
- Logann
- Orassans
- Equium

All of the races have been tested and function with Combat Extended.

The same can't be said of much of their equipment. While most of the guns and armor work within CE, they're more or less placeholders for when I go in and actually get everything to work the way they should.

Notes of note:
- Xenn and Orassan weaponry, while functional, is largely untested outside of seeing if they hold ammo and shoot. Needless to say, they have not been balanced.
- I have no idea if Xenn and Orassan armors work the way they should. Same with any of the other race's native gear.
- The Logann's shotgun straight up doesn't work. It holds ammo and looks mean, but it can't be fired and the bayonette cuts like a butter knife.
- The Xenn Frost Cannon sets things on fire.
- The Ferret Guns are wholesale ripped off of the Rimfire CE patch.
- Equium and Logann pawns don't carry any ammunition.
- Orassans might spawn with ammo. Might.
- Some Leeani troops don't carry ammunition due to being small woodland creatures.

Feedback is appreciated!
